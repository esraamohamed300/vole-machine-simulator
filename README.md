# vole-machine-simulator
This project is a Vole machine simulator that loads and executes programs step by step. It validates instructions, updates registers, memory, and the screen, and displays system status after each step or at the end. The design follows OOP principles, including components like the control unit, memory, registers, and an instruction processor.
