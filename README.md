# Vole Machine Simulator üöÄ  

## Overview  
This project is a *simulator for the Vole machine and its assembly-like language. It allows users to **load programs from files, execute instructions step by step, and display system status* (registers, memory, PC, IR, and screen). The simulator is designed using *OOP principles* to provide modularity and scalability.  

## Features  
‚úÖ Load and run Vole machine programs  
‚úÖ Step-by-step instruction execution  
‚úÖ Validate and execute instructions  
‚úÖ Display system state in a structured text format  
‚úÖ Ignore invalid instructions gracefully  

## Supported Instructions  
The simulator supports Vole's machine language instructions, including:  
- *LOAD* (Load register from memory or immediate value)  
- *STORE* (Store register value in memory or screen)  
- *MOVE* (Copy values between registers)  
- *ADD* (Integer and floating-point addition)  
- *JUMP* (Conditional jumps)  
- *HALT* (Stop execution)  

## How It Works  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load a program from a file (space-separated instructions).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The simulator fetches and executes instructions step by step.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ At each step, it updates registers, memory, and the program counter.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ The user can view the system's status after each step or at the end.  

## Technologies Used  
- *C++* for implementation  
- *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* for modularity  
- *File handling* for program loading  
- *Memory management* for simulating registers and execution flow
